## Why pick me?

#### Love üíñ

It is no exaggeration to say that for the past 12 weeks I have non-stop lived and breathed code and I loved every second of it. Unfazed by the demands of a full-time bootcamp, I even worked on additional projects on top of the challenging course material. Some were self-motivated extensions on weekend challenges - check out [Infinite Rock-Paper-Scissors](https://github.com/zi-codes/infinite-rock-paper-scissors), a web app that allows you to play the classic playground game with a theoretically infinite weapon set. Some were inspired my meetups and talks I attended - checkout [#DeepTag - ML hashtags for lazy instagrammers](https://jovial-sinoussi-42a9cd.netlify.com/), inspired the Upskilling Series on Machine Learning we had one evening at Makers. Others were were created pure out of love for puzzles  - for example [Base Emoji](https://github.com/zi-codes/codex-emojicrypt), a ruby program that can convert a base 10 number to any other base, even emojis, with full suite of tests.

#### Team Spirit üßòüèΩ‚Äç

With my classroom experience and formal pedagogical training, I am experienced in cultivating positive work environments and encouraging growth mindsets. In my time as a teacher my managers and clients have praised my ability to teach difficult and abstract concepts in a clear and concise way. All these skills proved very useful in our group coding projects - after just 6 weeks of learning to code our team went above and beyond for our first group project and built a [full stack web app in Rails](https://github.com/zi-codes/Airbe_or_not_to_be), despite having no prior experience of the framework. For our final group project we worked incredibly effectively as a small but determined group of 4 to build ["job tinder"](https://github.com/zi-codes/jinder-frontend), an app that was packed with features and optimised beautifully for web and mobile. From early morning team brunches to late night bug fixing, daily mood check-ins and (corn alert) matching t-shirts, we had an incredible amount of fun and made something we were extremely proud of. 

#### High Standards üíØ

I strive for the absolute highest standards in everything I do. You can see this in my professional career, where I was awarded 'Outstanding' (highest possible grade) in all 8 teacher's standards during formal observations from senior leadership, as well as in my academic record - I was awarded a prestigious ability-based scholarship in my time at Oxford. I am also able to respond quickly to constructive feedback - on my first process review at Makers I was still marked as 'improving' in half the areas, in just one week I had worked on all these sufficiently to pass all 8 criteria. 

I take great care to write modular and easy-to-change code that exemplifies OOD principles, with the highest standards for UI and UX also. I always go above and beyond the original specification, e.g.:

- week 2: was asked to make a Roman Numeral Converter up to the number 10, I made it [up to the number 1,000,000](https://github.com/zi-codes/codex-roman-numeraliser)
- week 5: when asked to make a 1 player bowling scorecard, I made a [multiplayer scorecard that also implemented responsive web design](https://github.com/zi-codes/bowling-challenge)

#### Fast learner üßΩ

I absorb new material quickly and keenly, particularly when it comes to written language (human or programming). In addition to all the core course languages and frameworks learnt I also took time to self-teach [Python](https://github.com/zi-codes/gilded-rose), [React](https://github.com/zi-codes/squiggler) and [React-Native](https://github.com/zi-codes/deeptag-app). At university I was one of the very few students who read Classics without prior knowledge of Latin, but I was able to master it in my first year at university and achieved the 15th highest score in the whole cohort in my moderation examinations regardless. I completed a Bloomsbury Summer School course on Egyptian Hieroglyphs the same year too, purely out of love for exploring different ways of codifying meaning.

#### Resilient üíé

I have a successful record of not only delivering under intensive circumstances but flourishing in such adversity and taking on additional challenges. Throughout the intensive bootcamp I was still working part-time at weekends and still managing to complete my weekend homework and attend additional coding events such as [Codebar](https://codebar.io/) every week. Both my degree and the day-to-day of inner city classroom teaching have reputations for being notoriously tough in different ways - from producing two quality essays a week every week to teaching challenging classes with challenging behaviours while under observation -  I am used to delivering under pressure and do not shy away from challenge.

#### Busy Bee üêù

Outside of work I am used to organising large teams and liaising with multiple agencies. I was chosen by the committee to be president of Oxford's largest film society, organising regular screenings of 6-7 films a week to a packed out auditorium.
Until recently I was also chairperson of one of [London's largest board game and geek culture meetups](https://www.meetup.com/OverBoardLondon/), and with the help of my wonderful team we've grown the community to over 8000 members.
